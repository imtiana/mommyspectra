Not all mothers can breastfeed, and not all babies can drink formula. Accordingly, there is a big market 
out there for natural, fresh breastmilk. As a result of this need, a lot of mothers have formed scrappy 
communities on the internet where they can easily find mothers willing to donate extra breastmilk.
Unfortunately, much of time this process is highly disorganized. Women join massive Facebook groups
where finding women in your local area is a difficult task in it of itself, and payment is decentralized.
We thus decided to created a site devoted to optimizing this sensitive and important issue, putting
mothers' needs first and creating a safe, local community for fellow mothers to bond.
